## üß† Overview
[**Data Context Hub**](https://www.datacontexthub.com/) is a platform designed to integrate data from multiple sources into an explorable knowledge graph, enabling users to visualize and traverse complex relationships within their data.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ETL for Graphs**  
  Extract data from various sources (e.g., relational databases, flat files, JSON, SOAP, XML), transform it into a graph structure, and load it into a Neo4j graph database.

- **Graph Builder Services (GBS)**  
  The core component that processes data into a knowledge graph using Data Pumps and manages workflows via Apache Airflow.

- **Explorer**  
  A user-friendly interface for navigating and analyzing the knowledge graph.

- **Memory For Your AI (M4AI)**  
  Generates a knowledge graph to provide contextual information to AI models, enhancing their ability to deliver domain-specific insights.

- **Deployment**  
  Deployable on Kubernetes using Helm charts.

## üîÑ Integration with Data Context Hub

At [DCH](https://www.datacontexthub.com/), we leverage the [C64](https://www.c64.ai/) stack's principles to facilitate:

- **Seamless Data Integration**: Transforming disparate data sources into cohesive knowledge graphs.
- **Contextualization**: Enriching data with contextual information to enhance decision-making.
- **AI Integration**: Utilizing structured data to fine-tune AI models for specific applications.

Our platform provides tools like the [Graph Builder](https://www.datacontexthub.com/), [Data Explorer](https://www.datacontexthub.com/), and [Linked Data API](https://www.datacontexthub.com/) to empower organizations in transforming their data into actionable insights.
